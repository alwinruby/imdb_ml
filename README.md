# Machine Learning with imdb

**Goal** - find which machine learning model is best suited to predict sentiment (output) given a movie review (input).  Using the IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews available on Kaggle.

1. The Dataset and The Problem to Solve

2. Preparing The Data
     - Reading the dataset
     - Dealing with Imbalanced Classes
     - Splitting data into train and test set

3. Text Representation (Bag of Words)
     - CountVectorizer
     - Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
     - Turning our text data into numerical vectors

4. Model Selection
     - Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Decision Tree
     - Naive Bayes
     - Logistic Regression

5. Model Evaluation
     - Mean Accuracy
     - F1 Score
     - Classification report
     - Confusion Matrix

6. Tuning the Model
     - GridSearchCV
